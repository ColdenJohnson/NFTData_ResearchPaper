Notice the VERY low correlation between NFT price and various sentiment values. While there seems to be some slight correlations (see multivariable regression mtable) for certain sentiment values and in certain categories, there is certainly not a stront relationship immediately obvious.
Equally interesting, there are many relationships between variables (for example, disgust and anger seem to be relatively highly correlated).

Most common words across all categories -- this graph is dominated by the "gaming" token descriptions.

Average trading price in USD over time. Three similar categories, Metaverse, Art, and Collectible are simultaneously displayed.

Average price in USD filtered by category. Categories are Metaverse, Utility, Art, Collectible, Games, and Other. This visualization only includes queried data and is not a truly accurate or proportional representation of the overall NFT market. For example, because all NFTs in the 'Gods Unchained' ecosystem have been queried, this has shifted the reflected average price and is not representative of, say, the average price of 'Gaming' type NFTs on OpenSea.

Art has the most variation in terms of sentiment, and is near balanced across many categories (anticipation, joy, trust)

Metaverse is overwhelmingly positive, with very little variation or other emotions present.

"Collectible" is the only category with more negative than positive sentiment.

Notice how Utility tokens are dominated by Trust and Anticipation. This makes sense, when token use is considered.

Notice How Low the R-Squared is on this (despite p-values being significant)

R-squared here is quite high here -- it seems as though category is actually quite a good predictor of positive/negative sentiment.
